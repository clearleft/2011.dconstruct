                <p>Responsive design is one of the most exciting developments to hit the web for some time. But there&rsquo;s a common misconception that it involves merely slapping some media queries on to an existing desktop-centric site and labelling the result &quot;mobile-friendly.&quot; Nothing could be further from the truth. This workshop will demonstrate that truly effective responsive design must begin with the content first, which is then progressively adapted to a multitude of screen sizes and environments.</p>
                <p>This workshop will help you to construct web sites that will feel natural on a whole range of devices, from mobile phones to tablets, laptops, e-readers and devices we haven&rsquo;t even thought of yet.</p>

                  <p><strong class="fn">Jeremy Keith</strong> is a <span class="title">web designer and developer</span> with over a decade's experience of using and teaching web technologies such as JavaScript, microformats and HTML5. He has written three books, <a href="http://domscripting.com/book/">DOM Scripting</a> and <a href="http://bulletproofajax.com/">Bulletproof Ajax</a>, and most recently, <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers">HTML5 For Web Designers</a>. When he&rsquo;s not crafting websites at <a href="http://clearleft.com/">Clearleft</a>, Jeremy can usually be found ranting and raving at conferences like <a href="http://aneventapart.com/">An Event Apart</a>. Right now he&rsquo;s very excited about responsive web design, which he feels may herald an even bigger revolution than the original web standards movement.</p>

                 <p>In his spare time, Jeremy plays bouzouki in the band <a href="http://saltercane.com/">Salter Cane</a>, curates an online Irish music community called <a href="http://www.thesession.org/">The Session</a> and runs <a href="http://huffduffer.com/">Huffduffer</a>, a site for creating podcasts of found sounds.
