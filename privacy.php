              <h2>Information</h2>
              <h3>Information Collection</h3>
              <p>Clearleft Ltd is the sole owner of the information collected on the dConstruct website. We collect information from our users at several different points on our website.</p>
              <h3>Log Files</h3>
              <p>Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (<abbr>IP</abbr>) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (<abbr>ISP</abbr>), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyse trends, administer the site, track usersâ€™ movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. <abbr>IP</abbr> addresses etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
              <h2>Site Communications</h2>
